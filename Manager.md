# Manager README

TL;DR: **I’m here to help and support you, to set context for what you’re working on, and to advocate for you and the team with the rest of the company.**

### Motivation for this document
I am excited to get to know you more personally. That said, I want to jumpstart our working relationship by documenting by predilictions, nuances, and tendencies when leading people. I hope this will allow us to get acquainted with each other faster. I also want to provide expectations to create more comfort in holding me accountable for being my best self.

### My role
1. Attract and retain diverse, world class talent
2. Help people grow based on their career desires and the needs of the company
3. Manage and build autonomous and inclusive engineering teams with a high degree of ownership
4. Set context to ensure the right problems are fixed in the right ways

### My approach
I take a people-centric approach to leadership. I aim to create a space where the teams I lead feel safe, feel empowered, and take on a high degree of ownership. I generally work like a "servant leader" but I actively dislike the term "servant leader". The word servant is just *weird*. No colleague is a servant, a master, or anything else. My view is, we're all equals doing different roles with different experiences and different responsibilities.

I defer to the team as often as possible. Sometimes I'll present some ideas on a given topic we'll be discussing to create a jumping off point. Generally, I want the team to have a part in nearly all decisions.

There is very little room for saying "no" on the teams I lead. A given suggestion may not be feasible but my belief is, as engineers, we're paid to find solutions. Instead of "no", it's "that won't work but if we did this it would..." or other derivations thereof.

### My Expectations
You were hired because of your experience and skills. I am not here to tell you how to do your job. I believe you are able to operate as a professional adult, and make smart decisions. That said, I *do not* expect you to do everything on your own. In fact, I expect you not do much on your own. Software Engineering is social; the best solutions are collaborative.

I am here to provide you guidance and mentorship. Sometimes I'll refer you to others who can do a better job with a given topic or have an interesting perspective. When you need help, I expect you to not hesitate and ask for it. If you feel you made a mistake, own up to it. Expect me to do the same.

### 1:1s
My general cadence for 1:1's is to do them bi-weekly for 30 minutes. These meetings are *your* meetings to lead about topics you're curious, concerned, or excited. These meetings are not places to discuss status or projects.

### Process
A smart process helps a team achieve results, stay organized, and make sure things are done. I believe there is a place for process on a team. Further, certain processes are in place to enable me to successfully manage up and out to the rest of the organization. However, I do not believe in process for the sake of process. I do not believe in dictating a process. I will attempt to improve process but I prefer when the team is proactive, using retrospecticves, in improving its process. Everyone wants the team to operate at it's best at all times, and having a process that makes sense for everyone is critical.

### Skills I value
1. Self-awareness; a thorough understanding of personal strengths, weaknesses, and areas of improvment are foundational to collaboration, career planning, and growth.
2. Leadership; I value leaders, both vocal leaders and leaders who lead by example. I cannot be the only one leading on the team.
3. Ownership; I value ownership, both of code and of process. I value precision over speed. I would rather code take 25% longer and be *done* forever.
4. Collaboration; I value collaboration on problems big and small. The collective intelligence of a team always creates better solutions.

### Working with me day-to-day
I am nearly always available to be interrupted. I am always available to talk.

Unless specifically asked to provide my opinion or give advice, I will do my best to refrain from doing either. This applies to both functional topics and interpersonal ones.

### Conflicts
I am the last line of defense for conflicts. Everyone is capable of resolving conflicts with their colleagues on their own. I will push back against being a moderator until work has be done 1:1 to resolve the conflict. There is an expectation of empathy and respect and, if present, these should resolve conflicts effectively.

### My Weaknesses
I can delegate and defer decisions too readily when, at times, there's a need for direction. I can also offer advice when not asked.
