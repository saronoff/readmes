# Employee README
TL;DR: **I want as much responsibility and autonomy as I can get to fail, to learn, and to grow to feel like I am going forward. I want to know I'm moving in the right direction.**

### Motivation for this document
I am excited to get to know you more personally through our time together at Oscar. That said, I want to jumpstart our working relationship by documenting by predilictions, nuances, and tendencies when being lead. I hope this will allow us to get acquainted with each other faster. I also want to provide expectations to create more comfort in holding me accountable for being my best self.

### My Asks
I was hired because of my experience and skills. I want to have as much room as possible to solve problems autnomously. I want as much free reign as possible, within the confines of Oscar, to approach problems in new ways. I am happy to talk through my approach or philosophy. Hopefully, you can rest assured I've thought about my approach or am gathering data on it. Nothing I do is done without purpose.

I like to collaborate to solve problems and get buy-in from other smart people on my approaches. That said, if I don't ask for advice or suggestions, I'm probably still collecting data on whatever it is I'm doing. If you're concerned, let's talk about those concerns so we can arrive at a place where we're both comfortable.

TL;DR: **I want to talk about the "what" more than the "how". I want to be trusted with the how.**

### My Quirks
I can get nervous or anxious when I start to feel like my understanding is not accurate. I can get frustrated quickly when I feel overwhemled and just need a minute or two for a walk to decompress.
